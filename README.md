# How to use this program

1. Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the server

```
python server.py
```

3. Customize the script.js file with your preferred pass and fail terms

4. Add the contents of script.js to your browser script manager (e.g. TamperMonkey, UserScripts, etc)

If you have trouble running the script/the server is slow, edit the model_string parameter of server.py to a smaller model
